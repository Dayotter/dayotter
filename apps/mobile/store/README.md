### Full description

DayOtter is the open-source home for your time. Connect Google, Outlook, and
iCloud, share one booking link, and let people grab a time you're actually free
— no back-and-forth.

- **Every calendar, one place.** Sync all your calendars so DayOtter always
  knows when you're busy.
- **Share your availability.** Send a link; people pick from times you're open.
- **Team scheduling.** Find a slot your whole raft is free — collective and
  round-robin, no paywall.
- **Protect your focus.** Buffers, daily limits, and focus blocks keep your
  calendar from filling up.
- **Confirm-first AI.** Ask it to move a meeting or defend deep-work time — it
  drafts a proposal and never touches your calendar until you say so.
- **Yours to run.** Self-host the whole thing for free, or use the cloud.

## Building the Android app bundle (.aab) for Play Store

The binary is built in the cloud with EAS (no local Android SDK needed). The
build config lives in [`../eas.json`](../eas.json) (→ `production` profile emits
an **app-bundle**); the app id is `com.dayotter.app`, versioned by
`android.versionCode` in [`../app.json`](../app.json).

One-time setup, then build:

```bash
npm i -g eas-cli          # or: npx eas-cli@latest
eas login                 # your Expo account
cd apps/mobile
eas init                  # links the project (writes extra.eas.projectId)
eas build -p android --profile production
```

EAS generates and stores the upload keystore for you (or run
`eas credentials` to supply your own). When the build finishes it prints a URL
to download the signed **.aab** — upload that in Play Console → Production →
Create release. Bump `versionCode` (or rely on `autoIncrement`) for each
subsequent upload.

To push straight to Play from CI later: `eas submit -p android` (needs a Play
service-account JSON configured under `submit.production`).

## Screenshots (capture from the app — not generated here)

Stores require real device screenshots; generate them from the running app:

- **iPhone 6.7" (1290×2796)** and **6.5" (1242×2688)** — required for App Store.
- **Android phone (min 1080×1920, 16:9 or taller)** — 2–8 shots for Play.

Suggested frames: Home (booking link + upcoming), a public booking page,
Availability editor, Team shared-availability, Insights.
